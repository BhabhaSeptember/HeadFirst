A)
 
1)  To read text from a SocketChannel:
SERVER--> SocketChannel(bytes from server)--> Reader--> BufferedReader--> CLIENT

2) To send text to a SocketChannel:
CLIENT--> PrintWriter--> Writer--> SocketChannel(bytes to server)--> SERVER


B)

1) What two pieces of information does the client need in order to make a connection with a 
server? = Server IP address and TCP Port number

2) Which TCP port numbers are reserved for “well-known services” like 
HTTP and FTP? = 0 through 1023 

3)
TRUE or FALSE:  The range of valid TCP port numbers can be represented 
by a short primitive. = FALSE in Java, because Java short can’t hold values above 
32,767

1) I need to be shut down or I might live forever 
= ExecutorService

2) I let you talk to a remote machine 
= SocketChannel, Socket

3) I might be thrown by sleep() and await() 
= InterruptedException

4) If you want to reuse Threads, you should use me 
= Thread pool, ExecutorService

5) You need to know me if you want to connect to another machine 
= IP address, host name, port

6) I’m like a separate process running on the machine 
= Thread

7) I can give you the ExecutorService you need 
= Executors

8) You need one of me if you want clients to connect to me 
= ServerSocketChannel

9) I can help you make your multithreaded code more predictable 
= Thread.sleep(), CountDownLatch

10) I represent a job to run 
= Runnable

11) I store the IP address and port of the server 
= InetSocketAddress
